#SPARC

This repository is setup to make figures and code available for **SPARC**, an approach for simultaneously measuring mRNA expression levels and targeted protein levels in single cells. In a paper that has been accepted we use SPARC to measure dynamic expression changes in human cells during neuronal differentiation and show that mRNA levels are poor predictors of protein abundances and activity in individual cells, indicating that the measurements are complementary. 

## Publication

The method and results are described in the published paper **A combined approach for single-cell mRNA and intra-cellular protein expression analysis** published in **Communication Biology**

## Code

Code to generate the figures, supplementary figures and supplementary tables in the paper can be found in the code section

## Data

Protein and RNA expression data is found in the data folder. 

## Figures

Figures included in the paper can be found under results/figures
